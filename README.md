### Hi, I'm Devanil ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„

I like to see myself as a software developer who combines technical skills with a product-focused mindset. I am deeply committed to maintaining well-structured code, with a particular passion for OOP and architecture. I actively develop my communication skills to effectively bridge business objectives with user value. I thrive in methodologies that promote autonomy and asynchronous communication.

I specialize in Ruby on Rails for backend solutions and Hotwire and React for frontend development, but I am continually expanding my knowledge in various other technologies as well.
